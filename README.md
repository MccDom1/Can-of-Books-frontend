This project was built in collaboration between Immanuel Shin and Dominique McClaney. The following is our agreed upon team agreement.
### Logistical
What hours will you be available to communicate?: 9-5
What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone â€¦)?: Slack
How often will you take breaks?: Once - lunch
What is your plan if you start to fall behind?: Drop unnecessary tasks (i.e stretch goals). Ask TA for help.
### Cooperative
Strengths:
- Immanuel: Task completion, communication, time efficiency, organization.
- Dominique: Leadership, communication, operation management, people skills.
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?:
- Have a cohesive plan of attack, appropriately allocating jobs to fit each person's strengths, and utilize communication to effectively cooperate.
In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?:
- Immanuel: Decision making.
- Dominique: Technical skills, coding capabilities.
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?:
- Following a routine: 1 PST/4 EST meetup. Work from there.
### Conflict Resolution
What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?:
- Don't let that happen in the first place. Each team member will have individual accountability. If all else fails, we call JB, or a TA.
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?:
- Settle accounts through honorable duel. Attempt to talk things over. Otherwise, call JB/TA.
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?:
- Both parties will give due diligence in explaining thought processes and plans. Each party will make a respectable attempt to keep the other party in the loop.
